## OpenBOR UWP Guide

### Requirements
- **External Drive** - Required to store your game files and other data.  

### Preparing Your External Drive
1. Connect your external drive to your PC.  
2. At the root of the drive, create a folder named `openbor`.  
3. Inside the `openbor` folder, create the following subfolders:  
   - `Logs`  
   - `Paks`  
   - `Saves`  
   - `Screenshots`  
4. Drag and drop your OpenBOR games into the `Paks` folder.  

### Using OpenBOR
1. If you have more than one game in the `Paks` folder, a list will appear.  
   - To select a game from the list, press the **Start** button on your controller.  
2. If you only have one game, it will load automatically.  

**Important Notes:**  
- Pressing the **A** button when selecting a game will open the logs, and there is no way to exit this screen. To return, you will need to restart the app.  
- This is a **test build**, and some features may have bugs.
