## Relic Hunters Zero

### Install Relic Hunters Zero
1. Install the `RelicHuntersZero.appx` via the dev portal.
2. Launch **Relic Hunters Zero**, and you're ready to play!  

### Additional notes
- If the game starts in a bordered window:
  1. Open **Settings** on your Xbox.
  2. Navigate to **General** > **TV & display options**.
  3. Go to **Advanced** > **Video fidelity & overscan**.
  4. Disable the **Apps can add a border** option under **Overscan border**.
- Pressing the **Start** button dims the screen slightly. Pressing it again returns the brightness to normal. This is a known issue with the GMS runner, not the game itself.
