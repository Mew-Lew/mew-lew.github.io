### Install Sonic 2 SMS Remake

2. Launch **Sonic 2 SMS Remake**, and you're ready to play!  

#### Additional info
- If the game starts in a bordered window:
  1. Open **Settings** on your Xbox.
  2. Navigate to **General** > **TV & display options**.
  3. Go to **Advanced** > **Video fidelity & overscan**.
  4. Disable the **Apps can add a border** option under **Overscan border**.
- In Sonic 2 SMS Remake, pressing the **Start** button dims the screen slightly. Pressing it again returns the brightness to normal. This is a known issue with the GMS runner, not the game itself.  
- Sonic 2 SMS Remake, the **Competition** mode has been removed as it does not function correctly on the Xbox.
