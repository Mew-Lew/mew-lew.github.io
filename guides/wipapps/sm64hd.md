## SM64HD Fan Remake (Super Mario 64)

> This project was a continuation of the Super Mario 64 HD Remake developed in the Unity Engine. However, it has been archived due to years of inactivity and the advancements of the SM64 Decompilation Project. If you're interested in reviving or building upon it, feel free to fork the repository.

### Install SM64HD Remake:
1. Install the `SuperMario64HD_1.0.1.0_x64_Master.appx` via the dev portal.
   - Include the `Microsoft.VCLibs.x64.14.00.appx` dependancy.
2. Launch **SuperMario64HD**, and you're ready to play! 

### Controls
- **Left Stick (Up/Down/Left/Right)**: Movement  
- **A**: Jump  
- **X**: Strike  
- **RB**: Crouch  
- **Start**: Pause  
- **Right Stick (Up/Down/Left/Right)**: Camera controls (Move In/Out/Left/Right)

### Additional Notes
- This project includes only one level, as it was discontinued years ago. We hope this inspires someone to port the full SM64 decompilation in the future.
- **Right Stick Left/Right** is inverted, and there is no option to change this.
