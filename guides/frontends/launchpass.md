# What is LaunchPass?
#### Guide Author: Delta
LaunchPass is a Frontend that is capable of launching ROMs in most Emulators on Xbox One and Series S|X Consoles.

# Requirements Checklist

+ **External USB Drive**
You will need a properly formatted USB drive to use LaunchPass. The USB drive must be formatted in NTFS and have the correct permissions - see the [Dev Mode Setup Guide](https://wiki.xboxdev.store/DevModeSetup#setting-up-usb-drive-for-emulation) for the steps. We recommend using an external SSD for smoother performance.

+ **Developer Mode on Xbox**
To run homebrew applications such as LaunchPass, you need to enable Developer Mode. This allows you to install applications that aren't available from the Microsoft Store. If you haven't enabled Developer Mode yet, don't worry - we've got you covered [here](https://wiki.xboxdev.store/DevModeSetup).

+  **LaunchBox**
You will need LaunchBox to use LaunchPass.
